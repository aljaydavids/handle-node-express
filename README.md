Simple template for using Node.js with express and handlebars

This template has been setup mainly for my own use, but anyone can use it to get started with a simple stripped down application without any fancy stuff, and was created as a starting point for learning more about Node.js + Express.js + handlebars.js

Please Note: You have to install Node.js and NPM first before you can actually use this code.

## Installation
You can run the init.sh or init.bat files or add these lines via terminal

    $ npm install
    $ node app
    
This will install the node dependencies and run the application
